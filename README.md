# Welcome to fragment.
------
**Fragment** is pieces tool togather, current it's so small.
Contain tool such as
> * event delegate
> * run once

## How to use this tool

### Use bower install
```$bower install fragmentjs
```
### Use npm install
```$npm install fragmentjs
```
### Download the zip file.
Now npm and bower not contain the test file, I well fix it. fragment.js is the only file you need, but the test file can tell you how to use. So if you need, just download.

If you just need once function, see **underscore.js**, this once function is a simple version.
